## Ionic 3 seed project with JWT and route guards

This project is based on the original Ionic 3 project with sidemenu, plus:
* support for JWT 
* translation service
* route guards

I've also setup a demo backend project, to support this one - [Laravel JWT](https://github.com/vmanchev/laravel-jwt)

Using this seed project, you'll have a working example of 
* user registration
* user login
* user logout
* authenticated CRUD requests to the backend
* examples of forms processing
* translation service
* route guards
* custom services
* very simple backend environment configuration (e.g. URLs to your backend API and endpoints)


### ToDo
* Forgot password
* Reset password
* Update user profile
